          <p>My name is Erik Plimmer and I was born in Bloomington/Normal, IL and moved to the Phoenix, AZ area when I was in
            4th grade. Growing up in the city was a really good experience for me because I've learned how to adjust to living
            a fast-paced lifestyle. Living in such a diverse community has also taught me how to interact with a wide variety
            of people which has really helped with my social skills and my understanding of people who come from various
            places. While living in the Chandler area of Phoenix I met my girlfriend and soon to be wife whom opened my doors
            to learning a new skill, how to be a father. We now have two children, a son and a daughter. My children have
            taught me one of the most important skills, patience. It hasn't always been easy to be patient with my kids and
            wife but I've learned over time that my patience will help them and myself in the long run.

          <p>With this new found strength and responsibility of being a father I built up the courage to strive for a career
            change to help support my family in a more comfortable financial situation. I decided to finally leave my existing
            position in telecommunications to learn a new skill in coding through this boot camp. For this to happen, I had
            to relocate my family to Apex, North Carolina to live with my older sister who offered to provide for me and
            my family while I attended school. This new journey will put all of my previous skills that I had mentioned,
            to the test. I'm very eager to see where this journey will take me in the long run.
